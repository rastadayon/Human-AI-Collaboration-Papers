### Human-AI Collaborative Bayesian Optimisation
Could be potentially useful for the defense part of the attack!

### Evaluating and Rewarding Teamwork Using Cooperative Game Abstractions
No AI involved but they predict how well a team of individuals can perform together using cooperative game theory. Could be useful! 

### Modeling Human Trust and Reliance in AI-Assisted Decision Making A Markovian Approach
They perform analysis based on Prospect Theory.
